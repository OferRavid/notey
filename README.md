# Notey

This is a streamlined RESTful API designed for a note-taking application, featuring user authentication that enables users to create, read, update, and delete notes. Notey is developed in Go utilizing the Echo framework, PostgreSQL for data management, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication.

## Motivation

I created this Note Taking App because I wanted a simple way to jot down thoughts and ideas without the clutter. As a backend developer with background in DevOps, I aimed to build something that’s not just functional but also easy to use, reliable and scalable. With a focus on quick access and secure data handling, this app is perfect for anyone looking to keep their notes organized and accessible anytime, anywhere. Whether you’re a developer wanting to dive into the code or just someone looking for a handy note-taking tool, I hope you find this project useful and inspiring!
